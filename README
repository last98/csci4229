This assignment took me about 75-80 hours.

For every plant in the greenhouse scene, I carefully positioned each leaf in 3D space and was very meticulous about the translation, rotation, and scaling. I have a lot of variety of plants placed around the room. For all the geometry, I had to adjust the texture coordinates so the texture fit accordingly. I also put a lot of thought into the color scheme so everything in the scene flows together well. During this project, I experimented with creating unique geometry to draw the leaves of plants. The views 0-4 are ones I'm most proud of and show I met the requirements as stated in my project proposal, as well as some of the stretch goals.
